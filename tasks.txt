Read in: ver 1
	get number of ants and number of rooms  and start/stop rooms (save names).
		(coordinates will only be taken by the visualzer)
	malloc array of size number of rooms
	read links and add rooms to array with hashing function
		(
			ie.
			rm1-rm2
			add rm1 with hashing
			add rm2 with hashing
			add index of rm2 to linked list of rm1 neighbors
			add index of rm1 to linked list of rm2 neighbors
		)

	read links and set to each node linked list of array indexs

Algorithm:
-INIT GRAPH set ALL edges to 0.
As you enter room make twin room and set edges between room OUT and twin IN, set edge as 1 set reverse edge as zero
the read room conections
-each room is divided into two nodes, IN and OUT
-each of these nodes contain linked list of (directed) links and the value of these edges

if we go from ROOM1 out to ROOM2 in (and edge 1) 
	-if the edge between ROOM2 IN and ROOM2 OUT is 1->travel is OK
	
-BFS
-find a way to store paths
	including length

paths are stored as linked list of structs that contain a linked list of indexes of path
and length of path

make generaic functions for free memory of lists etc
